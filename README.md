This script utilizes the google/deplot model from Hugging Face's Transformers library to extract structured data from images of figures or charts. It processes an image to predict the underlying data table presented in the figure.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or later
transformers
Pillow
requests (if not already installed)
Installation
First, install the required packages using pip. Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install transformers requests Pillow
Usage
Prepare your image: Save your target image in a directory accessible by the script. Supported formats include JPEG, PNG, etc.
Run the script: Execute the script to process the image and extract the data table. Adjust the path in the script to point to your image file.
Here's a quick breakdown of the script's functionality:

Load the model and processor: Uses AutoProcessor and Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration for image processing and data extraction.
Open the image: Utilizes PIL to load the image.
Generate predictions: Processes the image and extracts data using the loaded model.
Output: The script prints the extracted data table in a structured format.
Example
After setting up your environment and script as described, you should adjust the image_path variable to the location of your image:

python
Copy code
image_path = "/path/to/your/image.png"
Run the script, and it will output the extracted data directly in the console.

Additional Notes
Ensure the image contains clear, structured data (like charts or tables) for optimal results.
The quality of the extraction may vary based on the complexity and quality of the image.
